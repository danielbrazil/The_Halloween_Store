			<p>I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.</p>
			<p>If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, stories, and films. And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.</p>
			<!--Modify the HTML for the first heading in the section so it’s displayed on two lines.
			Modify the second heading as shown. Then, add the image (cat1.jpg) and the link below the
			heading. The link should display a page named cat.html in the products folder.-->

		<!--Code the product categories as an unordered list with links to other pages. Because these pages don’t exist, you
		can name them anything you like. However, you should assume that they will be stored in the products folder.-->
