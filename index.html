	<h1>Welcome to my site. Please come in and stay awhile.</h1>

	<p>I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.</p>
	<p>If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, stories, and films. And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.</p>

		<!--Code the product categories as an unordered list with links to other pages. Because these pages don’t exist, you
		can name them anything you like. However, you should assume that they will be stored in the products folder.-->
		<h3>Product categories</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href=./products/#>Props</a></li>
			<li><a href=./products/#>Costumes</a></li>
			<li><a href=./products/#>Special Effects</a></li>
			<li><a href=./products/#>Masks</a></li>
		</ul>

		<h3>My guarantee</h3>
		<!--Boldface the last sentence of the guarantee....-->
		<p>
			If you aren't completely satisfied with everything you buy from my site, you can return it for a full refund.<b>No questions asked!</b>
